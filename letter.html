            Hello, I hope you're doing well po First I want to greet you Happy Valentines Day!! 
            This Letter noo uhm webpage I made is for you. 50/50 if I send it to you or not, 
            this is the folder you saw while I'm sharing my screen, also this webpage is not 
            purely mine I use google then little modify shits and I made this letter to idk 
            to tell you that idk, it's been a while that we're not talking I miss you so much 
            but I know there is someone you are admiring already, It's okay you finally find 
            the right person? I hope he is the right person for you. Also maybe I made this 
            letter because maybe this is the last letter that I'm going to write to you? I'm 
            not saying I'm raising the white flag, I'm not, I already gave up once but as 
            I said Before I'm still here waiting again even though there is no chance, 
            I'm still admiring you, I'm still here listening to your chikas that I already 
            miss late night talks I miss it, but I know why you already stop talking to me 
            don't worry I know that hehe I know you, Why am I still choosing you even though 
            there's no chance? It's because you inspired me a lot just like playing guitar for 
            the first time just to sing to you but until now I can't play a single song I hope 
            someday you will hear a song while I'm playing a guitar, I felt what I don't felt 
            before, I'm not like this before you chance me a lot from idiot boy to lover boy 
            hehehe idk until now still an idiot hehehe. Idk maybe this feb 14 you're doing well 
            lots of boys will give you flowers, chocolates but me this simple webpage flowers 
            shits hehe I'm sorry because I can't afford a real flower also idk how to give to 
            you because it's to far between me and you. Also I will never forget the first time 
            we met I love that day that's the best day of my life, I hope someday we meet again 
            just like before, enjoying, laughing, playing, chikas AAAAA lots of memories like 
            playing in the midnight AAAA lots of lots of missing events. Also remember that 
            I'm still here, you can talk to me, if you need help I'm here, assignments, rants, 
            if you have a problem you can talk to me also take care of yourself take care of 
            siopao heyhey also your fams, one day I hope I can pay the songs I owe you I never
